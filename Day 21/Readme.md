Problem Solved: Same Tree

Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/



📌𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡



✅If one of the nodes is 𝐍𝐔𝐋𝐋 then return the equality result of p and q.

✅This boils down to if both are 𝐍𝐔𝐋𝐋 then return 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐞, but if one of them is 𝐍𝐔𝐋𝐋 but not the other one then return 𝐟𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐞



✅At this point both root nodes represent valid pointers.

✅Return 𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐞 if the root nodes have the same value and the left tree of the roots is the same (recursion) and the right tree of the roots is the same (recursion). 

✅Otherwise, return 𝐟𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐞.
