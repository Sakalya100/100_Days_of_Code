📌𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡



- In this, we will iterate from left to right and find if we can jump to the next position or, not and if we can jump, what will be the maximum jump.

- Maximum Jump we can take will be ( present jump-1 ) or (maximum jump at next position ).

- If at any position we have maximum jumps = 0, this means we can't jump further, hence return 0.
