📌𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡

✅ Use set to store the subsequences

✅ Iterate each number to compare with the existing subsequences

✅ If the last element is less than the current element, we can add this number to the subsequence

✅ We can also do the same if the subsequence is empty

✅ Filter the subsequences to build the final answer
