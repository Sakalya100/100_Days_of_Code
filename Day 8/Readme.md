With the boom in the technological domain and the increase in numbers of companies provisioning jobs, there is also an observed spike in Attrition Rates.

Being a HR and an integral position holder in the organisation, its a part of job responsibility to help and tackle the problem of Employee Attrition Rate.

Employees being a core asset to the company, analyzing and assessing the reason for them exiting the company is important.

Raw tabular data being very monotonous and difficult to analyze, we are designing a Dashboard to understand which department, gender, Education Field and Age groups have higher Attrition rates and thus act and plan accordingly to reduce it as much as possible.

I being a Data Analyst provide our dashboard infront of the OPs team to act accordingly on the insights.

To analyze and scrutinize the attrition rate of the company and conclude the parameters where the Attrition rate observed is maximum, to properly draw an insight from raw tabular data into easily interpretable numbers and graphs leading to better analysis and action on the same.

I have analyzed and reflected upon insights based on the following:<br><br>
✅Department Wise Attrition using Pie Chart<br>
✅Education Field wise Attrition using Bar Chart<br>
✅Attrition Rate by Gender and different Age groups using Doughnut Chart<br>
✅The Attrition count based on Gender using Lollipop Chart<br>
✅The Job Satisfaction rates using Heatmap<br>
✅Number of employees in each age group using Bar Chart<br>
