✅ First create 2 sets. Then add nums1 elements to set1, and nums2 to set2.This will give us 2 sets with unique elements only.

✅ Now,  just iterate to all elements of set1 and add those elements to first sublist of result list, which are not in set2.

✅ Similarly, iterate to all elements of set2 and add those elements to second sublist of result list, which are not in set1.

✅ Now, we got our result list.
