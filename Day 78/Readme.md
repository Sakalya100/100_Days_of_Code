📌𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡

✅ Pure Mathematical Observations

✅ We can see that 𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫𝐬 have 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬, the number itself and 1.

✅ The numbers that are 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐬𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐞 have even number of factors as well(>2).

✅ But the number that are 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐞𝐜𝐭 𝐬𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐡𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐨𝐝𝐝 𝐧𝐮𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬 as the number squared is considered as single factor.



💡But Why look for numbers having 𝐨𝐝𝐝 𝐟𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐬?

✅ If we look carefully, the bulb at these positions are 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐨𝐧 after the entire toggling.

✅ So if we find the numbers that are perfect square, they will be the ones remaining on.

✅ And the number of perfect squares in the range of n, is given by 𝐬𝐪𝐫𝐭(𝐧).
