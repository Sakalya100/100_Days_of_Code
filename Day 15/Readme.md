笨Count the frequency of unique numbers in tasks

笨For each frequency:

      箝品f freq is 1, return -1

      箝品f (freq-2) % 3 == 0, we need (freq-2) / 3 + 1 rounds to bring it to 0.

      箝品f (freq-4) % 3 == 0, we need (freq-4) / 3 + 2 rounds.

      箝品f freq % 3 == 0, we need freq / 3 rounds.

      箝標e have only one case left, which is using 2 all the way, so we need freq / 2 rounds.

The code can be further optimized, basically, we just need 攝懺攝橇攝｢攝･(攝溟攝ｫ攝橇攝ｪ/3) for all valid cases.

Examples:

leftover = 2, we need (freq-2) / 3 + 1 == ceil(freq/3)

leftover = 4, we need (freq-4) / 3 + 2 == ceil(freq/3)
