📌𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐚𝐜𝐡

✅ We use the 𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐭() function in vectors

✅ The algorithm used by sort() is IntroSort. 

✅ Introsort being a hybrid sorting algorithm uses three sorting algorithm to minimize the running time, 𝐐𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐭, 𝐇𝐞𝐚𝐩𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐭 and 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐨𝐫𝐭. 

✅ Simply putting, it is the best sorting algorithm around. 

✅ It is a hybrid sorting algorithm, which means that it uses more than one sorting algorithms as a routine.
